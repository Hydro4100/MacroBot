MacroBot - A Visual Macro Editor
================================

MacroBot is a powerful, node-based visual scripting application for creating flexible macros for games and desktop automation. Its intuitive drag-and-drop interface allows you to build complex automation scripts without writing a single line of code.

Key Features
------------

-   **Node-Based Editor:** Create logic flows by visually connecting nodes on an infinite canvas.

-   **Rich Node Library:** Includes nodes for keyboard actions, mouse control (clicking, moving, scrolling), delays, and string manipulation.

-   **Easy Navigation:** Pan the canvas with a middle-mouse drag, zoom with the scroll wheel, and use the built-in minimap to get a high-level overview of your entire project.

-   **Customization:** Organize your workspace with resizable comment nodes and color-code your logic nodes to keep things tidy.

-   **Save & Load:** Save your complex macros to a file and load them back in whenever you need them.

-   **Hotkey Triggers:** Assign system-wide hotkeys to your 'Start' nodes to run your macros from anywhere.

-   **Safety First:** A configurable "Emergency Stop" hotkey ensures you can halt any running macro instantly.

How to Use
----------

1.  **Running the Application:**

    -   Download the latest version of MacroBot.

    -   Unzip the folder.

    -   Run the `MacroBot.exe` application.

2.  **Building a Macro:**

    -   **Add Nodes:** Drag nodes from the sidebar on the left onto the main canvas.

    -   **Connect Nodes:** Click and drag from a pin on one node to a pin on another.

        -   **Execution Pins (▶):** Control the flow of the macro.

        -   **Data Pins (●):** Pass data (like numbers or text) between nodes.

    -   **Start Point:** Every macro must begin with a **Start Node**. Only one Start Node is allowed per canvas.

    -   **Configure Nodes:** Click on the fields within a node to set values, such as delay durations, keys to press, or text to type.

3.  **Canvas Navigation:**

    -   **Pan:** Hold the middle mouse button and drag.

    -   **Zoom:** Use the mouse scroll wheel.

    -   **Minimap:** Click or drag on the minimap in the top-right corner to quickly jump to any part of your project.

Future Plans
------------

The application is built with future growth in mind. Potential monetization will follow a **freemium model**, where the core application remains free, with options to upgrade to a "Pro" version via a one-time purchase. This Pro version will unlock advanced features, while an optional subscription will be available for services with recurring costs like cloud sync and team collaboration.
